# Welcome to Checkeredbot

Checkeredbot is my very own personal Go project for use with my Twitch channels.

If you'd like to use it, go ahead and clone the project.

* Copy and rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your bot's username to "TWITCH_USER"
* To get an oauth token, [head over here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) to generate one and add it to TWITCH_OAUTH
* Add your personal username to "TWITCH_CHANNEL" which is the channel the bot will be actively listening in

`go run ./main.go` will start the script. Feel free to fork, star and make any PRs or feature requests.
